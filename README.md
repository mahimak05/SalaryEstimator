# SalaryEstimator

In this code, instead of using linear regression (where N=1), we will learn how to use polynomial regression to estimate a regression to estimate the salary of employees provided their training level. Through trial and error, we can estimate the best N value (the power of the polynomial) to best estimate the future salaries of employees. The independent variable is level, and the dependent variable is the salary. This code is primarily implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.10. Try this yourself!

This project is simply used for practice. I give all credit to Yazılım Teknolojileri Akademisi, on Udemy who has uploaded all practice on his course: https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-with-python-course/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=msYS1Nvjv4c&ranSiteID=msYS1Nvjv4c-9Us.oBks7rBCqti8pis4Pw&LSNPUBID=msYS1Nvjv4c&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads.
